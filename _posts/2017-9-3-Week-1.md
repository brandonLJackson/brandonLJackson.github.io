title: Software Engineering Week 1
---


**What are your expectations of the class?**: I would like to become as familiar as possible with the typical software engineers experience. I would also like to use this as a chance to truly learn Python, as it is one of the only common languages I've yet to have experience in.

**What did you do this past week?**: We briefly went over the origins of Python, as well as discussed what tools we'll be using in the class.

**What's in your way?**: There isn't a specific challenge that has been presented to me for now, but I do know that time will ultimately become a major factor that I will need to properly respect.

**What will you do next week?**: I will begin work on the Collatz project. Having worked on a variation of it before for OOP, I'm fairly confident in my abilities to complete it swiftly.

**What's my experience of the class?**: I adore professor Downing's lecture style, so I imagine my experience will be a good one.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**: For those who program in C#, have you heard of SignalR? It's a C# library by Microsoft that allows you to synchorniously interact between devices or services (phone, browser, etc.) without the need of websockets. I got to play around with it quite a bit lately, and it's given me a ton of ideas for side projects. If anyone is having some "programmers block" and wants to make something creative, I highly recommend you look into it.
