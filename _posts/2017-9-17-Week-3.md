title: Software Engineering Week 3
---


**What did you do this past week?**: This week we went over some of the finer details of Python container types such as sets, lists, and things of that sort. We learned that we can initialize most collections with other collections, with the exception of sets, which can only contain mutable items. Lastly I turned in my Collatz project. It was fairly simple as I was able to recall most of the material from OOP.

**What's in your way?**: This week I need to worry about managing my time for SWE and other classes with interviews. I've already had a few interviews on campus so far, and I've got more this upcoming week. With that in mind I'm worried these might interfere with my work schedule. 

**What will you do next week?**: Most of this next week I will be personally reviewing interview questions from cracking the coding interview. For SWE specifically I believe we'll be getting close to learning our groups for the remainder of our projects.

**What's my experience of the class?**: So far everything is as expected. I'm not too surprised with anything in the class yet, so thats good. I'm sure once we get to the more SWE parts of the class and further away from Collatz

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**: If anyone is worried about interviews coming up be sure to read cracking the coding interview. The book has a lot of good programming problems that will help you out for interviews to come!
