title: Software Engineering Week 4
---


**What did you do this past week?**: This week we went over more of the collections in Python, as well as listened to a talk from a Google Employee over the Google Cloud Platform. I've never worked with Google Cloud Platform before, but have used Amazon Web Services, so I'm hoping that it will be a relatively seemless transition. I also started working with my team on the IDB project.

**What's in your way?**: The IDB project is a pretty big undertaking that is taking a lot of planning to really figure things. Things are working out but schedules are kind of hard to synchronize as well.

**What will you do next week?**: This next week I'll be focusing on finishing the project with my group, as well as working towards the test the week after.

**What's my experience of the class?**: So far everything is as expected. I don't see any strange out of left field

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**: With the week of the career fair having come and gone, I would like to remind everyone that you can get a lot of good coding practice on hackerrank. It'll help you prepare for your interviews, and a lot of the coding challenges you'll get will be hosted through the same service. It would serve you well to grind out a few days on hackerrank before whatever company you want to interview with's interview. There are all kinds of questions that can prepare you for the future, as well as things that will refresh your memory. You can also look through other services like Leetcode for a similar experience.
